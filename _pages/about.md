Hello there, I am 韓羽晨, Yeu-Chern (Joseph) Harn. I am made from Taiwan and work in the US.

I am a data scientist and software engineer, loving every innovation and technology. The topics I've been working includes image classification, searching, object detection, image generation with GAN, mass spectrometry signal decomposition.

In my leisure time, I like to watch/read new research articles on AI, attending online learning courses, read novels, and watch YouTube, Netflix, and cook. Recently I  start blogging about the technical knowledge I have because I am a strong believer in "To teach is to learn, and to give is to take".
